# New York City Taxi Trip Analysis

## Overview

This project focuses on the analysis of taxi trip data from New York City. It explores various aspects of taxi usage, potentially including trip durations, distances, locations, fare analysis, and demand patterns.


## Data Sources

The primary datasets used in this analysis include trip record data for New York City taxis, likely sourced from the NYC Taxi and Limousine Commission (TLC). Due to the large size of these datasets, they are not stored directly in this GitHub repository.

**To run the analyses, you will need to download the data files from the following external links and place them into the specified directories:**

* **Green Taxi Data (`green.csv`):**
    * Download Link: `https://drive.google.com/uc?export=download&id=13fSdj3d8BiXLcuDy6OJ2OOboXP1SnZ0n`
    * Description: `[TODO: Briefly describe this dataset, e.g., Green Taxi trip records for a specific period]`

* **Historical Flight Data (`2008.csv` - used in Spark analysis):**
    * Download Link: `https://drive.google.com/uc?export=download&id=1eQhJwxwpIoCX7NyefkQPg_2NK13Ow1TR`
    * Description: `[TODO: Confirm if this is flight data or another taxi dataset and describe, e.g., Airline on-time performance data for 2008, used for related Spark exercises]`

* `[TODO: Add any other large data files with their download links and target directories]`

Please ensure the files are placed in the correct locations as specified for the analysis scripts and notebooks to function correctly.
